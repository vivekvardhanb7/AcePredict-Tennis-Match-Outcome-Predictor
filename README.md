**Author:** Vivekavardhan Berila  
**Date:** 13-08-2024

## Overview

AcePredict is a machine learning project designed to predict tennis match outcomes using player statistics and match data. The model leverages the XGBoost algorithm to deliver accurate predictions.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Model evaluation, data preprocessing.
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting algorithm used for training the model.
- **Pickle**: Saving and loading trained models.

## Setup Instructions
